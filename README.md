<summary>Guide for Bot Raiding</summary>
  
### A step-by-step guide
  
  1. Have admin privileges, or know another administrator that can add the bot for you
  2. Create a discord application at https://discord.com/developers
  3. In the application, go to the tab labeled "bot"
  4. create your bot
  5. Scroll down. Under "Privileged Gateway Intents", enable "server members intent."
  6. Scroll up, copy the bot token, and paste it into the "bot token" area in the raid tool window.
  7. Open the OAuth2 tab
  8. In the first checkbox which is labeled "scopes", select "bot."
  9. In the second checkbox which is labeled "bot permissions", select "administrator."
  10. When both options are selected, copy the url which appears under the first checkbox.
  11. Either open the URL and select the server (if you have admin), or send the URL to the admin who will add the bot to the server for you.
  12. Now, open the raid tool window
  13. Paste your proxies into the designated area
  14. Type your message into the designated area (must be less than 2000 characters)
  15. Paste the ID of the target server into the area which says "server id". You can find the ID by having developer mode enabled in discord settings, right clicking the server icon, and clicking "copy ID."
  16. Paste user ID's into the mass ban exemption area (only if you/your friends don't want to get banned). You can obtain the user ID's by right clicking your icon similarly to how one would obtain the server ID.
  17. Once the bot is added to the correct server, start the raid.
